### **Maybe your relationship isn't suffering from loss of passion... but rather, _fear _of passion.**

Maybe in your attempts to avoid rocking the boat or losing your partner... you lost yourself.

"My goal is not to diminish the raw intensity of intimate relating. My goal is for you both to become _adept in the heat of the fire _and stay connected, so you can experience all of what you came to relationship _for _in the first place."

-Ken Blackman
